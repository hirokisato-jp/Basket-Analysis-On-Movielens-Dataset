# Basket-Analysis-On-Movielens-Dataset

## Description
As I was drawn into recommendation system, my professor introduced me to a technique used in data mining called Basket Analysis. The technique has played huge role in data mining for business. 

## Concept / Programming Language / Libraries used
Python.  
Pandas.

Association Analysis.  
Apriori Algorithm.  
## What is Association Analysis?
Association analysis is a tool used to discover intersting common pattern of items in large data set. It reveals hidden association and create sets of items present in many transactions which are called frequent itemsets or association rules. 
### Association Rule
Association rules represents strong correlations between two items, and essentially can be described as if, then conditional statement.
### Example
```
{Diapers} -> {Beer}
```
Association consists of two important componets: antecedents and consequents. Antecedent is "if" part of the conditional statement and consequent is "then" part of conditional staement.  
Therefore, we can interpret the example as antecedent: diapers, and consequent: beer. Essentially implying that, if a customer buys diapers then they also buy a beer.   
This is used as the typical example of association rule.
