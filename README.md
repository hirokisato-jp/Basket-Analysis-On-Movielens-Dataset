## What is Association Analysis?
Association analysis is a tool used to discover intersting common pattern of items in large data set. It reveals hidden association and create sets of items present in many transactions which are called frequent itemsets or association rules. 
### Association Rule
Association rules represents strong correlations between two items
### Example
```
{Diapers} -> {Beer}
```
In analysis, this relation represents that if a customer bought a diaper, then they also bought a beer.
